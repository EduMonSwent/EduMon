## 🏗️ Architecture (MVVM)

The app follows a **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture for clean state management and modularity.

- **UI Layer (Jetpack Compose)** — interactive and modern composable screens  
- **ViewModel Layer** — handles logic, updates the UI, connects to repositories  
- **Data Layer (Firebase, Firestore)** — stores user progress, pet state, and planner data  
- **External Services Layer**
